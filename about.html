        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        <h2>Jude the Software Engineer</h2>

        <h3>Who I Was</h3>
        <p>My path to software engineering began with my studies in music composition. After studying for a couple of years, I decided I wanted to get to work with music. I decided to take a job with MakeMusic, Inc. supporting digital notation software.</p>
        <p>Everything from basic To-Do list apps, to the cutting edge of augmented reality interested me - I could not get enough of it. My job was to help people use music software and I loved it; however, I still felt I wanted more. I wanted to build the applications that our customers enjoyed, and I decided to make the switch.</p>

        <h3>Who I Am</h3>
        <p>I am an empathetic developer, not only for software users, but also for my team members. I rely on process and its perpetual improvement to produce complex software at pace. It is also important to me that I am able to pair with my teammates when building solutions. I often find that code that Iâ€™ve paired on is some of the best written.</p>
        <p>While I enjoy pairing styles like Driver-Navigator, my favorite type of pairing is having one engineer write a test and then having another engineer implement a feature to pass that test.</p>
        <p>I have a genuine passion for building well tested software - testing is how I design my code, and I continue to benefit from applying this methodology. My time at the Turing School of Software & Design exercised my abilities to create excellent APIs using both Ruby/Rails and JavaScript/Express using skills like pair programming and Test-Driven Development.</p>

        <h3>My Tech</h3>
        <p>My first love was <span class='js'>JavaScript</span>. At the time, I was self-teaching web development with <span class='html'>HTML</span>, <span class='css'>CSS</span>, and <span class='js'>JavaScript</span> so I could complete small web page updates and apps for my previous job. Whjen I decided to make the quantum leap and shift my career to software engineering, I decided that building backend technology to serve data to a frontend interface was my niche.</p>
        <p>So, I decided to attend the Turing School's backend engineering program which primarily utilized Ruby and Rails. Today, I would mark Ruby/Rails as my primary language/framework. A very close second would be <span class='js'>JavaScript</span>, utilizing frameworks like ExpressJS for backend technology and <span class='reactjs'>React</span> for frontend interfaces.</p>
        <p>I have also completed a project that utilized <span class='elixir'>Elixir</span>/<span class='phoenix'>Phoenix</span> to build an API for a provided frontend interface (see <a href='/quantified-self-api'>Quantified Self</a> for more details). Diving into learning functional programming through use of <span class='elixir'>Elixir</span> made this language and its acommpanying framework (<span class='phoenix'>Phoenix</span>) a key part of my coding toolbelt.</p>
        <p>I am always ecited to learn new technologies should the need arise. I find that utilizing the right technology for a project is crucial, so I like to keep my mind open about new tech/older tech/any tech! I consider myself a student at all times - if I find myself thinking I know all there is to know about something, then to me it means that I should be asking more questions. There is always more to learn.</p>
